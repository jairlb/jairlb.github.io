				My name is Jair (it is phonetically pronounced "Yaw + ear").
				In 2019 I attained a B.S in Cognitive Science specializing
				in Human Computer Interaction from UCSD. Since the time that I started
			  pursuing my undergraduate degree at university, I worked part-time at a tech
				startup as a junior software engineer, where I have been able to expand
				my software engineering skills and be a part of an agile development process
				of software creation. I have since transitioned to a full time position at
				the same company upon gradution where I continue to work in software,
				front-end, and mobile development.

				<div class="icon-padding">
					I am always trying to learn more about my cross-sectional field
					of interests and find the point where they all meet, and they do! As I am
					very passionate about how using the knowledge of cognitive science can
					expand my knowledge of computer science and vice versa.

			<div> I love cognitive science. In hindsight, it is an almost embarrassing fact
			that I knew nothing about Cognitive Science when I transferred to UCSD to join
			the Cognitive Science undergraduate program in 2017.
			Fast-forward to now, I have come to
			realize that the field involves everything I want from the sciences and the skillset
			for working in technology that I knew I wanted, which was to not only have a
			theoretical and abstract background of how software and technology work,
			but also a more nuanced human appraoch, to inform the design of systems
			ultimately used my humans.</div>
			<div>
			My cognitive science background provides me with a more holistic and
			versatile view of technology and thinking. The psychology and neuroscientific
			components of cognitive science provide an essential foundation to inform
			my design-based specialization and has instilled a user-first mindset
			and the ability to conduct user research to inform UI/UX creation and upkeep.
		  Meanwhile my computer science and programming knowledge provides me with
			more technical skills in addition to
			my experience working at a startup living the weekly Agile 2.0 life and
			making sure my tickets pass through Q/A and peer review lanes before
			moving to done. :)

				Throughout my time pursuing my undergraduate at UCSD and presently,
				I have gained experience working in the life sciences through working at
				at a local startup that offers technological solutions and assistance for
				digital clinical trials. I have been able to see the medical field rapidly
				evolve to embracing more streamlined approaches that utilize the technology of today.
			</div>
			<div class="icon-padding">
				I am fortunate to have this experience as it has demonstrated to me the
				synthesis between abstract technology, software engineering, and product
				applications while allowing me to build skills working in a formal development
				team. I have been able to witness and be a part of software creation from
				planning, launch, and upkeep which has reinforced how positively influential abstract
				sciences can be in the medical field and general life sciences.
			</div>
			<div class="icon-padding">
				My experience, along with my interdisciplinary and mixed cognitive science
				and computer science background, has me excited and eager to continue
				growing my skills and being apart of this kind of progress in the future.

				Learning has been a necessity and a constant in my life, not only for my
				professional endeavors, but for my own personal growth and getting my neurons
				firing and forming new connections.

				Outside of my professional pursuits in the sciences, during my free time I can
				be found in an arm chair listening to podcasts or reading with a cup of tea
				at my side and my trusty Sennheiser headphones in tow about cognitive
				neuroscience, theory of mind, history, or reading old literature.
				Suffices to say, I am a total book worm.

				I am also hoping to relearn how to play the piano and
				learn more about investing, two of my 2020 new year's resolutions.
