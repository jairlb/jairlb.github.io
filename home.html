			<div>
				My name is Jair (it is phonetically pronounced "Yaw + ear")
				and I have recently graduated from UCSD with a B.S in
				Cognitive Science specializing in Human Computer Interaction (in ~T-7 days!).
			  For the last two years I have spent this time working part-time at a tech
				startup as a junior software engineer, where I have also been able to expand
				my software engineering skills and be a part of an agile development process
				of software creation.

				<div class="icon-padding">
					I am always trying to continue to learn more about my cross-sectional field
					of interests and find the point where they all meet, and they do! As I am
					very passionate about how essential using the knowledge of cognitive science is to
					expand my knowledge of computer science and vice versa.

			<div> I love cognitive science. In hindsight, it is almost an embarrassing fact
			that I knew nothing about Cognitive Science when I transferred to UCSD to join
			the Cognitive Science undergraduate program in 2017.
			Fast-forward to now, I have come to
			realize that the field involves everything I want from the sciences and the skillset
			for working in technology that I knew I wanted, which was to not only have a
			theoretical and abstract background of how software and technology work,
			but also a more nuanced human aspect, to inform the design of systems
			ultimately used my humans.</div>
			<div>
			The advantages I have with my CogSci background is that it provides me to
			have a more holistic and versatile view of technology and thinking. The
			psychology and neuroscientific background inform my design-based specialization
			and had instilled a user-first mindset, in addition to the ability to
			conduct user research to inform UI/UX creation and upkeep. Meanwhile my
			programming knowledge provides me with more technical skills in addition to
			my experience working at a startup living the weekly Agile 2.0 life and
			making sure my tickets pass through Q/A and peer review lanes before
			moving to done. :)

				Throughout my two years pursuing my undergraduate at UCSD and presently,
				I have gained experience working in the life sciences through working at
				at a local startup that offers technological solutions and assistance for
				clinical trials in 1-3 phases.
			</div>
			<div class="icon-padding">
				I am fortunate to have this experience as it has demonstrated to me the
				synthesis between abstract technology, software engineering, and product
				applications while allowing me to build skills as a working in a formal
				team. I have been able to witness and be a part of software creation from
				planning to launch, which has reinforced to me the influential effects that abstract
				sciences can have in the medical field and life sciences.
			</div>
			<div class="icon-padding">
				My experience, along with my interdisciplinary and mixed cognitive science
				and computer science background, has me excited and eager to continue
				growing my skills and being apart of this kind of progress in the future.

				Learning has been a necessity and a constant in my life, not only for my
				professional endeavors, but for my own personal growth and getting my neurons
				firing and forming new connections.
			</div>
			<div>
				Outside of my professional pursuits in the sciences, particular areas I tend
				to be found in an arm chair reading about during any free time—a cup of tea
				at my side and my trusty Sennheiser’s in tow—are cognitive neuroscience,
				history, and reading old literature, as I am a total book worm.

				When not doing the above I am also an enthusiastic gamer
				(eagerly awaiting

				!!), I love to eat deserts, and be both a cat mama and proud nerd.
				I am also hoping to relearn how to play the piano and
				get better at learning Spanish, two of my 2019 new year's resolutions.
